"""General multi-step flow executor for v2 process models.

The executor owns the chain

    S_i -> resolve -> checkpoint (mutates_input) -> prepare -> execute
        -> commit -> S_{i+1} -> store

It is a thin, deterministic layer above :func:`resolve_execution` and
:func:`execute_plan`: every step is resolved against the *current* state, its
result is persisted, and the committed state is threaded into the next step.

Checkpointing
-------------
Variants that declare ``VariantCapabilities.mutates_input`` may change the
native geometry handle in place. Before such a step runs, the executor asks the
engine's :class:`~process_models.v2.state_backend.StateBackend` to checkpoint
the state, then re-resolves the request against the copy, so
``plan.request.state`` and the plan's execution both point at the copy and the
previous step's state is left untouched. A backend that cannot checkpoint is a
hard :class:`ExecutionResolutionError`, never a "mutates_input is probably
fine" fallback.

``execution_kind="field"`` steps are the deliberate exception: they mutate an
auxiliary native cell set, not the canonical level set. They do not
checkpoint, their domain/cell-set ownership is transferred directly to the
next step, and a failure aborts the run instead of restoring an earlier state.

Persistence
-----------
For every ordinary step the executor writes ``state.json``/``fields.npz``,
``outputs.json``, and ``plan.json`` through :class:`StateStore`, plus the
geometry reference returned by the engine's state backend (the step's
``geometry_ref`` is that file name, otherwise ``None``). A contiguous
``execution_kind="field"`` sequence is different: intermediate steps write
``state.json`` with ``fieldsOmitted`` (no dense arrays) and no geometry copy;
only the last step of the sequence snapshots the cell set and writes
``fields.npz`` once. After the last step one ``flow.json`` records the run::

    {
      "schemaVersion": 1,
      "runDir": "<absolute run directory>",
      "steps": [<plan identity>, ...],       # in execution order
      "versions": {"<engine id>": "<engine version>"}
    }

Per-step process/variant versions already live in the plan identity, so the
flow-level ``versions`` map only summarises which engine builds the run used.

Version pins
------------
A :class:`FlowStep` may pin ``expected_process_version`` and
``expected_variant_version``. Both are forwarded verbatim into the
:class:`ExecutionRequest`, so a pin that is not registered fails admission
with the registry's ``KeyError`` instead of silently running the newest
version.

Engine leases
-------------
Every :func:`resolve_execution` acquires an engine lease. A ``mutates_input``
step resolves twice (once before checkpointing, once against the copy), so the
first, abandoned plan's lease is released before the second resolution, and
the final lease is released in a ``finally`` after the step has executed and
been persisted. Callers therefore never have to close the leases behind a
returned :class:`ExecutionOutcome`; its plan identity stays readable because
release only drops the acquisition, not the dataclass fields.

Costs
-----
A non-field ``mutates_input`` step copies the native geometry handle before executing.
From the second step on the incoming state is already executor-private (the
previous step committed it), so that is a redundant second copy. It is kept as
an accepted validation cost for now: re-resolution must validate the exact
state the variant will execute on, and reusing an earlier handle would let a
wrong copy/alias corrupt an upstream state instead of failing admission. Do
not "optimise" this away without covering that failure mode.

This module does not snapshot, preview, call an API, or acquire external
engines; it is the runtime foundation only.
