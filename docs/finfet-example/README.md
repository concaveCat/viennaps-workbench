# FinFET.py acceptance fixture

This directory turns the upstream ViennaPS example
`/root/ViennaPS/examples/emulation/FinFET.py` into a platform acceptance test.
It does **not** add a script executor: the example is translated into a
schema-7 project and every operation runs through the ordinary workbench
dispatch, plugin, geometry, state and replay paths.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `reference/FinFET.py` | verbatim upstream script (SHA-256 `32ec9f2d…`) |
| `reference/FinFET_um.py` | µm twin retained for the scale-sensitivity cross-check |
| `reference/canonical.py` | order-independent surface/volume digest |
| `reference/run_reference.py` | runs a native script and writes `expected*.json` |
| `expected.json` | 26 surfaces + final volume from the original nm script (acceptance reference) |
| `expected-um.json` | µm twin, retained only as the native scale-sensitivity cross-check |
| `project.json` | equivalent schema-7 workbench project (25 steps) |
| `mapping.md` | line-by-line source-to-step and unit mapping |
| `../../tests/acceptance/test_finfet_example.py` | heavy API acceptance test |
| `../../scripts/accept-finfet-example.sh` | one-command acceptance runner |

## What is checked

- 26 native surface checkpoints: point/triangle count, material order,
  per-triangle material distribution and canonical SHA-256.
- Final volume: node/cell count, tetrahedral type, material distribution and
  canonical SHA-256 (`volumeMeshDelta = 0.05`).
- All 25 project steps succeeded through
  `VIENNAPS_WORKBENCH_V2_EXECUTION=1`; `/api/runs/{id}` exposes a `v2Steps`
  record with plan, outputs and state for every step.
- Replay of the same project/seed: final surface and volume digests repeat.
- The default path (v2 switch off) is untouched and covered by the fast
  regression suite.

## Unit frame

The workbench natively supports nanometre schema-7 projects
(`units.length = "nm"`, `units.rate = "nm/s"`). ViennaPS is unit-agnostic, so
the project values reach the native constructors unchanged: no ×0.001
translation is applied to lengths, radii, half-axes, cutoffs or rates.
`parse_project` installs a unit-aware validation context so the historical
0.5 µm grid / 40 µm domain / 2 µm feature limits become their exact
nanometre equivalents without changing any existing µm project. Snapshots and
native records carry `coordinateUnit = "nm"`.

The domain still uses an explicit `domain.bounds` array because the centered
`xExtent`/`yExtent` constructor always produces an odd number of grid points
per axis and cannot reproduce the native 128-point y grid.

The µm twin (`FinFET_um.py` / `expected-um.json`) is kept only to document a
measured ViennaPS limitation: the nm and µm native runs agree on surfaces
0–13 and diverge at surface 14 because level-set mask booleans are not
exactly scale invariant. The acceptance now compares the workbench directly
with the original nm `expected.json`.

## Running

Fast checks (no heavy simulation):

```bash
VIENNAPS_WORKBENCH_DATA_DIR=$PWD/var/test-finfet WORKBENCH_PORT=8767 \
  .venv/bin/python -m unittest tests.test_finfet_schema tests.test_finfet_geometry \
  tests.test_finfet_reference -v
```

Full acceptance (native reference twice, workbench project, replay):

```bash
scripts/accept-finfet-example.sh
```

Reuse the committed reference digests and only run the workbench + replay:

```bash
scripts/accept-finfet-example.sh --skip-reference
```

The heavy test is gated by
`VIENNAPS_WORKBENCH_RUN_FINFET_ACCEPTANCE=1`. Runtime artifacts stay below
`var/accept-finfet-*`; the 94 MB final volume is not committed.

## Acceptance evidence

Recorded API acceptance run (native nanometre project):

- run id: `397fe39a3ae0411f247b2150`
- status: succeeded, 25/25 v2 steps
- wall time: 1359.4 s (22 m 39 s), CPU only
- surface 25 digest:
  `6c7f348c412c67f7e87ebf093fff87a3554fecce9b4dbf25a30dbb9f1d0c5084`
- final volume: 2,075,499 nodes / 12,136,389 tetrahedra, digest
  `b5fab9041115584aa338c6aa56e349049526ec55557b970f26c2e1a0e79e974f`
- final volume file SHA-256:
  `a24688213d8fa65b9ff737c73c139648d5a3d3d0703e6f4dbeaa4a1d1e8d9369`
  (byte-identical to the original native volume)
- replay run id: `7bb99976ce4cbae02bfaf98c`
- replay status: succeeded; identical requested/execution hashes
  (`7fd3b590…`, `68f68978…`) and a byte-identical final volume file
  (`a2468821…`). The replay wall time was 3347.0 s because the acceptance was
  intentionally run alongside the regression suite; the first pass took
  1359.4 s.
- snapshots report `coordinateUnit = "nm"` and mesh values are not rescaled.

Known differences: none in the native nm frame. The nm/µm native scale
divergence at surface 14 is retained only as a cross-check, not as the
acceptance target.
