# Workflow provenance and measurement binding contract

**Status**: Binding v1 implemented; equivalence remains separate and unimplemented.
**Scope**: Measurement → Route/Attempt/Segment binding  
**Non-goal**: claiming that a measurement is a verified result of a real run until every required evidence item below is present.

## 1. Three independent status axes

A measurement has three separate facts. They must never be collapsed into one boolean.

| Axis | Values | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `measurementStatus` | `measured`, `no_intersection`, `ambiguous`, `material_not_found`, `region_empty`, `unsupported_dimension`, `unsupported_units`, `invalid_geometry` | Did the measurement algorithm produce a value? |
| `bindingStatus` | `unbound`, `verified`, `failed` | Is the measurement tied to a server-verified execution segment and step? |
| `equivalenceStatus` | `not_evaluated`, `established`, `failed`, `inconclusive` | Has numerical/semantic equivalence to a segment result been established? |

Rules:

- `measurementStatus=measured` does not imply `bindingStatus=verified`.
- `bindingStatus=verified` does not imply `equivalenceStatus=established`.
- Historical measurements may remain `unbound` forever without becoming invalid.
- A failed binding must preserve the original Measurement and record the reason. Do not overwrite or delete it.
- `Segment.runId` supplied by a user is not evidence. Only a server-established or server-verified link to a real run can grant `verified`.

## 2. Minimum evidence for `bindingStatus=verified`

| Evidence object | Minimum requirement |
|---|---|
| **Execution ownership** | Server establishes or verifies `Segment → actual Run`. The actual submitted project must match `segmentProjectHash` and the source `CompileRecord`. |
| **Segment input derivation** | From the full Compile, step range, starting checkpoint and actual seed, derive the expected Segment input; compare it with the real Run's `normalizedProject` (not only its hash). |
| **Target step** | The target step belongs to that segment; the run manifest contains its snapshot; the step is recorded as completed. |
| **Source identity** | Measurement `sourceStateId` equals the native state of that step; `sourceSnapshotHash` is recomputed from the snapshot actually read. |
| **Verification record** | Persist method version, evidence references, result, and failure reason. |

Additional rules:

- If any item is missing or mismatched, `bindingStatus=failed` (with reason) or remains `unbound`; never `verified`.
- The actual submitted project hash is compared to `segmentProjectHash`; the segment's `sourceCompileId` must resolve to an immutable CompileRecord.
- The expected Segment input is derived from the full Compile slice (steps, geometry/domain/material binding, solver settings, starting checkpoint and seed) and compared with the real Run `normalizedProject`. A matching hash alone is insufficient if the project cannot be derived from the Compile.
- If Measurement already has `sourceRunId` or `sourceStepId`, the binding request must match them. Equal geometry hashes do not permit reattributing the Measurement to another run.
- The run manifest must record the step as completed and reference the snapshot/state. A step that merely appears in a string field is not sufficient.
- If the snapshot is re-materialized or its content changes, `sourceSnapshotHash` must be recomputed and the binding re-checked.

## 3. Hash roles

| Hash | Role |
|---|---|
| `sourceSnapshotHash` | Identifies the measurement input snapshot content. |
| `segmentProjectHash` | Identifies the actual project submitted for the segment. |
| `CompileRecord.fullProjectHash` | Identifies the complete compiled flow. |
| `resultDigest` | Semantic result comparison for the segment's **final** state. |

Do not use `resultDigest` to validate an intermediate-step measurement. A CD/depth measured at step 5 cannot be compared with the segment's final-state digest. Numerical equivalence, when implemented, uses a separate `ComparisonProtocol` and explicitly stated scope.

## 4. Verification record

Proposed `ProvenanceVerificationV1`:

```text
ProvenanceVerificationV1 {
  methodVersion,
  verifiedAt,
  execution: {
    status: verified | failed,
    segmentId, runId,
    sourceCompileId, segmentProjectHash,
    submittedProjectHash, manifestRunId,
    reasons[]
  },
  targetStep: {
    status: verified | failed,
    stepId, stepIndex, completed,
    snapshotFile, snapshotHash, stateId, stateHash,
    reasons[]
  },
  sourceIdentity: {
    status: verified | failed,
    measurementStateId, manifestStateId,
    recomputedSnapshotHash, measurementSnapshotHash,
    reasons[]
  },
  equivalence: {
    status: not_evaluated | established | failed | inconclusive,
    comparisonProtocolId?, metricScope?, resultDigest?, reasons[]
  }
}
```

`bindingStatus=verified` requires `execution.status=verified`, `targetStep.status=verified`, and `sourceIdentity.status=verified`. It does not require `equivalence.status=established`.

## 5. State transitions

```text
unbound ──verify success──► verified
unbound ──verify failure──► failed (reason preserved)
failed  ──new evidence────► verified
verified ──same-binding re-verification mismatch──► failed (revoked)
verified ──different candidate fails──► verified (failure recorded separately)
```

- A measurement created with `POST /measurements` from a raw snapshot is `unbound` unless the caller also supplies a server-verifiable segment/run/step identity.
- `POST /measurements/from-run` may verify execution ownership only when the run/step/state exists and matches. Otherwise it returns the Measurement as `unbound` with a reason.
- Binding is idempotent for the same evidence; a new verification method version produces a new verification record, not a mutated old one.
- Verification records are append-only and carry their own ID. Measurement caches only the current status/evidence.
- A failed attempt to bind a different Segment/run/step must be recorded but must not automatically revoke an existing verified binding.
- The same failed binding may revoke `verified` only when it re-verifies the identical Segment/run/step and the current evidence no longer matches.

## 6. Persistence and API proposal

`measurements` table additions:

```text
binding_status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'unbound',
binding_evidence_json TEXT,
equivalence_status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'not_evaluated',
equivalence_evidence_json TEXT
```

Verification records are stored separately:

```text
measurement_verifications {
  verificationId, measurementId, status,
  methodVersion, evidenceJson, createdAt
}
```

Implemented endpoints for binding v1:

```text
POST /api/v1/workflow/measurements/{measurementId}/bind
GET  /api/v1/workflow/measurements/{measurementId}/provenance
GET  /api/v1/workflow/measurements?binding_status=unbound
```

Equivalence remains separate and is not part of `/bind`:

```text
POST /api/v1/workflow/measurements/{measurementId}/equivalence   # not implemented
```

`POST /bind` accepts an explicit `segmentId`, `runId`, `stepId` and evidence references; it must not trust arbitrary strings without manifest/state/snapshot checks. `GET /provenance` returns the current cached binding plus the ordered verification records.

## 7. Acceptance tests for the next stage

1. A user-supplied `Segment.runId` that does not match a real run leaves the Measurement `unbound`.
2. A step that exists in the manifest but is not completed cannot be bound.
3. A snapshot whose recomputed hash differs from `sourceSnapshotHash` cannot be bound.
4. A `sourceStateId` that differs from the manifest native state cannot be bound.
5. A submitted project whose hash differs from `segmentProjectHash` cannot be bound.
6. A valid run/step/state/snapshot/compile chain produces `bindingStatus=verified` and a verification record.
7. An intermediate-step measurement with no final `resultDigest` can still be `verified` for binding but remains `equivalenceStatus=not_evaluated`.
8. Revoking a verified binding after a hash mismatch sets `bindingStatus=failed` and preserves the original Measurement.
9. Historical measurements with no execution identity remain readable and `unbound`.

## 8. Invariants

- Measurement success and execution binding are independent.
- Binding requires evidence, not labels.
- `sourceSnapshotHash` is recalculated from the actual snapshot.
- `resultDigest` is never a substitute for intermediate-step binding.
- Failed or absent verification is explicit, never silent.

## 9. P4-2 measurement-driven workflow runs

P4-2 does **not** add control flow inside a native engine process. A *workflow
run* is a composition in the workflow control layer:

```text
Route
  └─ Attempt A (prefix) → Segment A (real run, succeeded, end checkpoint)
       └─ measurement at Segment A.throughStepId
            └─ MeasurementDecisionV1 (measurement, condition, resolved parameters)
                 └─ Attempt B (branch) → Segment B (planned, reuses checkpoint of A)
```

The `MeasurementDecisionV1` record is the only place where the branch condition
is decided. It stores the source Segment/Run, Measurement, recipe/metric,
operator/threshold, the measured value, the boolean result, the chosen branch,
the authored-step resolved parameters, the target compile, and the new branch
Attempt/Segment. Decisions on one Route form a sequence under one
`workflowRunId` (`wfr_...`); the first decision creates it, later decisions may
continue it.

Replay is record-driven:

- The original Measurement is reused; no new Measurement is created and the
  source snapshot is not measured again.
- `chosenBranch`, `resolvedParameters` and `measurementId` are copied unchanged.
- The target compile is rebuilt from `resolvedParameters` and must reproduce the
  recorded `targetCompileId`; otherwise replay is rejected.
- A new branch Attempt/Segment is appended with `replayOf=<originalDecisionId>`.

This preserves Route → Attempt → Segment → Run → Compile provenance. It makes
no claim that the branch was executed inside one native process; the branch
Segment is a normal bounded run that starts from the reused prefix checkpoint.
