"""Bridge between the worker's live Domain and the v2 ProcessState.

The legacy worker owns ``ctx.domain`` and ``ctx.field_state``.  The opt-in v2
execution path keeps a ``ProcessState`` in ``ctx.v2_state`` so process and
geometry steps share material order and (when present) the field sidecar.
Any legacy or no-op step that mutates the Domain invalidates the cached state;
the next v2 step rebuilds it from the live Domain.
