"""Installed ViennaPS/ViennaLS identity and version-qualified policy.

ViennaPS 4.7.0 / ViennaLS 5.10.0 is the default runtime. The 4.6.2 runtime is
retained for replay, legacy runs and the two capabilities that 4.7.0 does not
provide (the patched multi-ion GPU build and the 2D Faraday cage etch).
Everything that depends on a concrete engine version belongs here instead of
spread-out literals.

``EVIDENCE_ENGINE_VERSION`` is deliberately *not* the installed version: the
archived capability/evidence matrices in ``docs/`` were measured against 4.6.2
and stay pinned to that run. Only current-runtime metadata uses
``engine_version()``.
