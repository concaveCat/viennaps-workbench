"""Per-project workflow UI state (schema 11).

The document only remembers *which* compile, route, segment runs, measurements
and experiments the project's 03 page is currently showing. It deliberately
copies no compile/route content: those records stay the single source of truth
and the state must not become a second, stale copy of them.

All identifiers are format-checked here and existence-checked by the store on
write. Reads never re-validate references, so a state whose target was removed
by GC still loads and the UI can turn the resulting 404 into an empty panel.
